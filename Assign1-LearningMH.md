# Assignment #1 Malaika Hussain - What I've learnt

Throughout this project I've learned the basics and the importance of Version Controls such as Git, Github, and Github Classroom.
Prior to this I had little knowledge concerning version controls, but I knew they were of some sort of importance. 
The following outlines what I have learnt.

## Git

From my understanding a version control such as Git, records changes to a project overtime in a database known as a **repository**.
It allows access to project history so, anyone apart of the repository is able to see what changes have been made to the project from others.
A version control also allows users to revert a project in case an issue appears. 
This is very helpful as it eliminates having to extract different version of a project especially when working in a team when everyone is working on the same project.

## GitHub

Github is essentially a platform for users all over the world to collaborate and upload their software for millions to use. Github's workflow is quite fascinating and works in the following way:

- **Issue**: A user of the project uses Github's issues feature, where they are able to outline a feature, bug, or a question they have about the project. The projects team is able to reply to the user.

- **Branches**: A branch is created off the main branch of the project. The importance of the branch allows for a project member to work on a copy of project without obstructing the main project. Within this branch a project member to able to create a feature, or fix a bug for the project.

- **Pull Request**: Once the project member is done with the **issue**, they are able to open a **pull request**. This allows for team members to review the changes that will be made to the main project. After everyone has agreed upon the changes, they are then able to merge the pull request. By merging the pull request to the main branch, the project is updated with any of the changes that were made and is available for anyone.

# What I am confused about

Although I have learnt alot about version controls, there are still a few things that I am confused about.
The following outlines my concerns:

1. I don't really understand why markdown is used within Github? The syntax can be a little confusing at first especially when platforms such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word have easier ways to bold, highlight, create tables, etc. 
2. Another thing I'm still a little confused about is navigating github as it didn't seem too straight forward and can be a little overwhelming for those new to Github.

Overall, I'm very excited what Github has to offer and it's importance within my field.
